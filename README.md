Programming for Data Analysis Project 2019

## Introduction ##

## Problem Statement ##

For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of
your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is
of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data
related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.
We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.

Specifically, in this project you should:
1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
   collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
   relationships with each other.
3. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
4. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
   data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
    
Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some
students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to
base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),
but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set.

## Packages used in this project ##

The following packages were used to run statistical analysis and draw grpahs for this project.

Python https://www.python.org/downloads/

Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ - is the easiest way to perfrom Python data science machine learning on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.

iPython https://ipython.org/ - it an interactive command-line terminal for Python.

Numpy http://www.numpy.org/ - is the fundamental package for scientific computing within Python.

Jupyter Notebook https://jupyter.org/ - is an open-source web application that allows the creation and sharing of documents that contains live code, equations, visualisations and narriative text
